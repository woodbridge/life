A little implementation of Life with python and pyglet. May be useful to if you're trying to figure out how to actualy apply pyglet's API.

## Controls

- **enter** - start/stop the simulation
- **r** - generate a new seed

Click on individual squares while paused to manually tweak the generation.

## How to Run

- `pip install pyglet`
- `python game.py`

*Please ignore my embarassing usage of global variables to manage state...*
